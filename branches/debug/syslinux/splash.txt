09 You can enter manual boot commands using the "archie" prefix or use the menu
 system by typing "menu".

0f Nesting:
09 Using nesting allows you to store new and changed files on your local
 partitions while using Archie. Once you specify the target partition, Archie
 will automatically detect on each boot the nested partition and use the
 existing configurations, files and packages from there. you have two types of
 nesting :

0f root nest:09 Use a partition to save updated data from Archie's entire image.
 You will be able to change your startup files, install new packages, etc. if
 you have an existing /home directory in your nested root partition with
 existing users directories, Archie will use your selected user.

0f home nest:09 Use a partition to save updated data from Archie's /home
 directory. If you have already existing users directories Archie will use
 your selected user.
